Description: Provides the CASP rule for shrinkage prediction in
    high-dimensional, non-exchangeable hierarchical Gaussian models 
    with an unknown location as well as an unknown spiked covariance structure.
    CASP utilizes the phase transition phenomenon of the sample eigenvalues 
    and eigenvectors seen in spiked covariance models and improves 
    upon naive factor model based methodology by using bias-corrected 
    efficient estimates of quadratic forms involving the covariance matrix 
    that appear in the Bayes predictive rules.
