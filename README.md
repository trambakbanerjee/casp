This is an R package for Coordinate-wise Adaptive Shrinkage Prediction (casp) in a high-dimensional non-exchangeable hierarchical Gaussian model with unknown location as well as unknown spiked covariance structure. CASP [1] uses results on the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of high-dimensional sample covariance matrix ([2], [3], [4]) to develop a bias-correction principle that leads to an efficient approach for evaluating the Bayes predictors corresponding to popular loss functions such as
quadratic, generalized absolute, and linex losses.
 
Installation
-----------
You can install  `casp` using `devtools`.

 ```R
   devtools::install_github("trambakbanerjee/asus")
   ```
  
  If you are looking for the R scripts that reproduce the analysis in the paper [1] then please use the folder [Numerical Experiments](https://github.com/trambakbanerjee/CASP_paper) for more information.
